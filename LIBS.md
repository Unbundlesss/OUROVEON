OUROVEON is built on the shoulders of many marvelous open source libraries. Those in use and their respective licences are listed below. To make this file vaguely readible, standard licence text is provided as links back to opensource.org instead of copy-pasting the MIT text 400 times. All LICENCE files are also included with the library source distributions.

**CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS**

## FLAC - Free Lossless Audio Codec

Copyright (C) 2001-2009  Josh Coalson

Copyright (C) 2011-2016  Xiph.Org Foundation

This file is part the FLAC project.  FLAC is comprised of several
components distributed under different licenses.  The codec libraries
are distributed under Xiph.Org's BSD-like license (see the file
COPYING.Xiph in this distribution).  All other programs, libraries, and
plugins are distributed under the LGPL or GPL (see COPYING.LGPL and
COPYING.GPL).  The documentation is distributed under the Gnu FDL (see
COPYING.FDL).  Each file in the FLAC distribution contains at the top the
terms under which it may be distributed.

Since this particular file is relevant to all components of FLAC,
it may be distributed under the Xiph.Org license, which is the least
restrictive of those mentioned above.  See the file COPYING.Xiph in this
distribution.

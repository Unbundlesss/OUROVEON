# BEAM : Connection & Playback

BEAM is very simple to get working with. Once you've set up the app, you will see the default UI with no connected jam.

### Step 1 - click on Browse ...

This will open up the jam browser, allowing you to pick which jam to playback.

### Step 2 - choose your jam

You can select from your own private jams, subscribed jams, from the current list of publics or the huge archive of public and shared jams. Click one to select.

### Step 3 - begin tracking the jam

Clicking **Begin Tracking** will start a background process where every few seconds, BEAM asks Endlesss if there are any new riffs in the chosen jam.

While the button is green, BEAM will be checking for changes and you cannot change what it is focusing on. If you want to track a different jam, click the button again to stop the continuous checking.

### Step 4 - yeah that's about it mate

BEAM will now pull, schedule, blend and play riffs as they come in. You're up and running.

Each time a new riff arrives, BEAM will show that the transition is scheduled. Once the cross-fade begins, it will be shown happening in the same section.

## Fine Tuning

To change when and how long the transition fading takes, examine the **Riff Blending** options.

**Trigger Point** controls when during a riff the transition can happen - at any point at all, at the start of a riff or on one of the quarter beats. 

**Transition Time** chooses how long that transition will take.

If you make changes, the **Activate** button lights up - hit this for your changes to take affect. You can always see which settings are currently used under the **Active Riff Blending** section above.

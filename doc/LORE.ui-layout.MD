# LORE : UI Layout

### Customisation 

The UI is built out of re-arrangeable modular windows. To move a window, grab the tab bar with `Left Click and Drag` - then hold `SHIFT` to enable the docking system to choose where to place the window when you release the left mouse button.

If you make a mess or want the default layout back, click `WINDOW -> Reset -> GUI Layout`

This can also be used if you upgrade to a new version and find the windows not fitting properly - although the app should reset the layout if major UI changes are made between versions.

### Panel Pages

Each window can have multiple 'pages' that can be leafed through. These pages usually tuck more advanced options away so that the most useful view is uncluttered. 

Any switchable window will be marked either with a list of available pages in the tab bar title, eg. `Data Warehouse [■ □]` or with a small extra stripe in the top-left corner if the window is not showing a tab bar.

To switch pages, either:

* hover over a window and tap `PAGE UP`

* `Right-Click` on the tab bar
